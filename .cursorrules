**YOU MUST USE RUBRIC ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR EVERY FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION, DELETION, MODIFICATION, REFACTORING**

**BEFORE CREATING A NEW FILE, YOU MUST FIRST CREATE A CORRESPONDING RUX FILE**

**AFTER IMPLEMENTATION, YOU MUST RUN `node rubric/validate.js` AND ALL CONDITIONS MUST PASS**

Code Quality:
- Functions should do one thing
